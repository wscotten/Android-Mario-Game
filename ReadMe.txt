Play as mario by using the arrow keys on the lower right of the screen by running with the left and right arrow keys and jumping with the up arrow key. The goal of the game is to advance to the next level by reaching the flag at the end of each level. Collect powerups along the way to earn points while also avoiding enemies along the way. Use the right square button on the lower left to shoot fireballs as fire mario.
Pass through all 3 levels to complete the game.
